The Healthy Neighborhoods project is an attempt to combine population data sources at the cesnsus tract, census block, or zip code level and combine them with health outcomes related to ambulatory care sensitive conditions.

The project will then use basic machine learning methods to sort varaibles and create models that help understand the social determinants of health in certain neighborhoods.

The goal is to equip public health professionals who are already active in the area with a more precise focus on the mechanisms that lead to negative outcomes in the neighborhoods in their community.
