#### The Healthy Neighborhoods Project
## Using Open Data and Public Programs to Improve Community Health

### Mission: 
# Improve daily living for the members of our communities with open access public health data and neighborhood based public health programs. 

### Vision: 
# Neighborhood based healthcare delivery in our communities where everyone benefits, no one is excluded, and is sustainable for the next generation. 

### Strategy: 
# 1. Investigate open access population data that helps us better understand the health of those in our neighborhoods.
# 2. Analyze hospital focused economic data that integrates health equity among our neighborhoods.
# 3. Evaluate the process and impact of grassroots, innovative, public health programs that already exist in our neighborhoods.
# 4. Introduce community coalition health improvement policies that can bring development to our neighborhoods. 

### Projects:

## 1. The Neighborhood Discovery Library -
An assembly of open access data sources that provide social, economic and environmental data at the MSA (market), County (community), Census Tract (neighborhood), and participant (member) level. 
The library consists of collected tables that connect the different data sources by the geographic identifier for a given year range. These tables are able to be analyzed using basic machine learning variable reduction techniques to develop models for informing further research, to inform evidence based screening methods, and to create risk assessment instruments.  
The library is designed to partner with a practioner in the community to answer questions specific to their community and provide tools deployable in their context. 

## 2. The Neighborhood Data Residency
In order to develop partnerships and integrate evidence from a wide variety of sources, students are recruited to participate in a program evaluation and data science focused residency housed within a community health program. 
They will be provided extra education on evaluation, community based participatory research, database management and data security, implementation theory, project management, research coordination, and coding for data science in Python and R. The students will also be setup to receive research coordination credentialing following the program. 
The residency will house them inside a community program where they will conduct a process and outcome evaluation, assist in improving data collection and management, and help identify and apply for opportunities to gain external funding.
The residency will integrate practicum based approaches to student development while maintaining a positive impact on the community programs. 

## 3. The Neighborhood Policy Shop
Informed by equity based measures in health economics, work with coalitions in our communities and among our neighborhoods to introduce grassroots health focused policies that bring development for everyone. 
Identifying gaps, windows, and areas of consensus the shop will work with any and all parties to write samples for state and federal statutes and bring forward pertinent lawsuits that advocate for better community health. The focus will be on identifying voices in needs in the community that match gathered evidence and available openings for broadly desired change. 

### Ongoing Subprojects inside the Neighborhood Data Library 

# Neville: 
Using random forests, factor analysis, social media sourced qualitative analysis, and recursive feature selection to reduce variables among a dataset with more than 100 variables, this project is focused on creating a method of identifying underlying possible causes of health outcomes. Validation is conducted with linear regression or logistic regression accompanied by an ROC test. A demonstration is conducted using the NHANES dataset to identify a subpopulation for colorectal cancer research as well as predictors for teenage pre-diabetes. A second demonstration is conducted using the yRBSS to create a screening tool for negative weight perceptions among teenages as well as risk score for suicide ideation among students in school. 

# Cedric: 
Using measures of inequity in economics, this project uses the Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient to evaluate the concentration of poor health in neighborhoods among a market or community. Similarly, this measure can be used to identify what policies or infastructure is related to lower or higher equity. A methodology for practical use is demonstrated with the CDC 500 Cities dataset.

# Aberforth: 
Using an interrupted time series methodology for evaluating the impact of public health programs as well as county level health predictors from the USDA, EPA, and ACS, this project is focused on providing an informed understanding of state level health policies designed to improve outcomes. This is demonstrated with maternal mortality rates from the WONDER dataset and Medicaid expansion under the ACA. 

# Bellatrix: 
Using the processes in the neville and cedric subprojects, and data from FLCharts is combined with socioeconimc variables from the American Community Survey to understand the location and composition of diabetes related inequities in health. The focus will be to directly inform diabetes focused programs inside the DOH that are currently deployed in their communities. Partners: Kelsey Christiansen

# Mungos: 
Using value based reimbursement measures for hospital based providers from CMS, this project inegtrates processes from the neville and and cedric metholdogies to identify predictors for ways to improve value based reimbursements using public health programs. This project will be used to inform the Community Resource Paramedic Program inside Gainesville Fire Rescue. Partners: Lisa Chacko

# Severus: 
Using ACROS data from the Washington Post legal case, this projects seeks to identify the preliminary legal opioid distribution elements that led to higher rates of fentanyl related overdoses among states and counties. This project integrates the Aberforth methodlogy to evaluate policy impacts and Cedric methodology to incorporate inequity measures. Partners: Kelly Gurka
