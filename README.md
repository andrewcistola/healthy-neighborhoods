# The Healthy Neighborhoods Project
### *Using Open Data and Public Programs to Improve Community Health*

## Purpose:
Benefit the public health through the use of open source data science tools and program evaluation in partnership with community based public health programs in Florida.
## Mission: 
Improve daily living for the members of our communities and the public health programs that support them. 
## Vision: 
Neighborhood based healthcare delivery in our communities where everyone benefits, no one is excluded, and is sustainable for the next generation. 

## The Neighborhood Discovery Library: 
#### *Investigating open access population data that helps us better understand the health of those in our neighborhoods.*
An assembly of open access data sources that provide social, economic and environmental data at the MSA (market), County (community), Census Tract (neighborhood), and participant (member) level. 
The library consists of collected tables that connect the different data sources by the geographic identifier for a given year range. These tables are able to be analyzed using basic machine learning variable reduction techniques to develop models for informing further research, to inform evidence based screening methods, and to create risk assessment instruments.  
The library is designed to partner with a practioner in the community to answer questions specific to their community and provide tools deployable in their context. 

### Neville Longbottom Sub-project:
Using random forests, factor analysis, social media sourced qualitative analysis, and recursive feature selection to reduce variables among a dataset with more than 100 variables, this project is focused on creating a method of identifying underlying possible causes of health outcomes. Validation is conducted with linear regression or logistic regression accompanied by an ROC test.

*Detecting Youth Suicide Ideation*
YRBSS 2017 (US Youth)
A second demonstration is conducted using the YRBSS to create a screening tool for negative weight perceptions among teenages as well as risk score for suicide ideation among students in school.

*Colorectal Cancer Research*
NHANES 2005-2006 (US Patients), WONDER 2013-2017 + EPA/USDA/ACS 2013-2017 (US Counties)
A demonstration is conducted using the NHANES dataset to identify a subpopulation for colorectal cancer research as well as predictors for teenage pre-diabetes. 

*Diabetes Disease Progression in Florida*
WONDER 2013-2017 + EPA/USDA/ACS 2013-2017 (FL Counties), FLCharts 2013-2017 + ACS 2013-2017 (FL Census Tracts)

### Cedric Diggory Sub-project: 
Using measures of inequity in economics, this project uses the Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient to evaluate the concentration of poor health in neighborhoods among a market or community. Similarly, this measure can be used to identify what policies or infastructure is related to lower or higher equity. A methodology for practical use is demonstrated with the CDC 500 Cities dataset.

*Diabetes Hospitalizations*
500 Ciities 2013-2017 (FL MSA)

### Bellatrix Lestrange Sub-project: 
Using value based reimbursement measures for hospital based providers from CMS, this project integrates processes from the neville and and cedric metholdogies to identify predictors for ways to improve value based reimbursements using public health programs.

*Diabetes Inequity and ERR* 
CMS 2018 ERR (US Hospitals), 500 Cities (US MSA) 

## The Neighborhood Data Residency: 
#### *Evaluating the process and impact of grassroots, innovative, public health programs that already exist in our neighborhoods.*
In order to develop partnerships and integrate evidence from a wide variety of sources, students are recruited to participate in a program evaluation and data science focused residency housed within a community health program. They will be provided extra education on evaluation, community based participatory research, database management and data security, implementation theory, project management, research coordination, and coding for data science in Python and R. The students will also be setup to receive research coordination credentialing following the program. 
The residency will house them inside a community program where they will conduct a process and outcome evaluation, assist in improving data collection and management, and help identify and apply for opportunities to gain external funding.The residency will integrate practicum based approaches to student development while maintaining a positive impact on the community programs. 

## The Neighborhood Policy Shop: 
#### *Introducing community coalition health improvement policies that can bring development to our neighborhoods.*
Informed by equity based measures in health economics, work with coalitions in our communities and among our neighborhoods to introduce grassroots health focused policies that bring development for everyone. 
Identifying gaps, windows, and areas of consensus the shop will work with any and all parties to write samples for state and federal statutes and bring forward pertinent lawsuits that advocate for better community health. The focus will be on identifying voices in needs in the community that match gathered evidence and available openings for broadly desired change.
