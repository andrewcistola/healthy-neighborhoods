Outdoor Air Quality - Fine Particulate Matter:
Daily Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5) (µg/m³)
Years 2003 - 2011

Summary:
	   	

The Outdoor Air Quality - Fine Particulate Matter data available on CDC WONDER are geographically aggregated daily measures of fine particulate matter in the outdoor air, spanning the years 2003-2011. PM2.5 particles are air pollutants with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. Reported measures are the daily measure of fine particulate matter in micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5) (µg/m³), the number of observations, minimum and maximum range value, and standard deviation. Data are available by place (combined 48 contiguous states plus the District of Columbia, region, division, state, county), time (year, month, day) and specified fine particulate matter (µg/m³) value. County-level and higher data are aggregated from 10 kilometer square spatial resolution grids. Please read Cautions and Limitations section below.

In a study funded by the NASA Applied Sciences Program / Public Health Program (fully cited below), scientists at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center / Universities Space Research Association modified the regional surfacing algorithm of Al-Hamdan et al. (2009) and used it to generate continuous spatial surfaces (grids) of daily PM2.5 for the whole conterminous U.S. for 2003-2011. Two sources of environmental data were used as input to the surfacing algorithm, US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) PM2.5 in-situ data and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth remotely sensed data. They also identified in a Geographic Information System (GIS) the associated geographic locations of the centroids of the gridded PM2.5 dataset in terms of the counties and states they fall into to enable aggregation to different geographic levels in CDC WONDER. See also Data Source Information.

Average Fine Particulate Matter (µg/m³)

The average daily fine particulate matter summary measure is the mean value of all of the daily outdoor air fine particulate matter (PM2.5) (µg/m³) values that met the selected query criteria. For example, if results are grouped by Year and limited to the South Region for years 2003-2011, then the first row shows the value 12.35 (µg/m³) as the average fine particulate matter value for year 2003 in the South Region. This summary measure is the mean of the daily values recorded for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) (µg/m³) estimates of the 10 kilometer square spatial resolution geographic-area grids in the selected time and place.

How? This summary measures is reported by default for all queries.

Notes:

    The average measurement is the mean value of all of the daily values that met the selected criteria for time and place.
    This dataset contains daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5) (µg/m³) estimates of outdoor air quality. PM2.5 particles are air pollutants with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. The values are summarized to the county-level, from 10 kilometer square spatial area grids covering the 48 contiguous United states (not including Alaska and Hawaii) plus the District of Columbia.
    Fine particulate matter estimates are recorded for 10 kilometer square spatial resolution grids in the selected area. PM2.5 estimates from each grid are assigned to the county where the grid centroid is located. WONDER shows the summary the grid-level estimates into counties and larger areas. The county locations are from the 1999-2000 Federal Information Processing (FIPS) code set. 

Number of Observations

The number of observations is the number of daily fine particulate matter values that produced the summary measure. For example, for January 1, 2008, there were 80,650 fine particulate matter values averaged to produce the national average fine particulate matter value of 8.15 (µg/m³). The observations are the daily fine particulate matter values recorded for the 10 kilometer square spatial resolution grids in the selected time and place.

How? Select the checkbox labeled "# of Observations" under the "Optional Measures" heading in section 1. Organize table layout on the Request Form.

Notes:

    The number of observations is the total number of daily fine particulate matter values recorded for the 10 kilometer square spatial resolution grids in the selected time and place.

    MODIS fine particulate matter measurements are recorded for 10 kilometer square spatial resolution grids in the selected area. Measurements from each grid are assigned to the county where the grid centroid is located. WONDER shows the summary the grid-level estimates into counties and larger areas. The county locations are from the 1999-2000 Federal Information Processing (FIPS) code set. 

Range

The range shows the minimum and maximum measurements for the criteria that defines the cell in the table, from all of the grid-level estimates that contribute to the spatial average daily measurement. For example, when data are grouped by year and limited to the District of Columbia, for the 732 grid values of daily fine particulate matter in year 2008, the lowest value was 3.00 and the highest value was 34.50 (µg/m³).

How? Select the checkbox labeled "Range" under the "Optional Measures" heading in section 1. Organize table layout on the Request Form.

Notes:

    The range shows the lowest and the highest values in the set that defines the average fine particulate matter measurement in the table cell, in the format: (minimum - maximum). Daily values are recorded for 10 kilometer square geographic-area grids in the selected time and place.

The county locations are from the 1999-2000 Federal Information Processing (FIPS) code set. 

Standard Deviation

The standard deviation shows the variance from the average or mean value that occurs in the grid-level values that meet the place and time criteria that define the table cell. A low standard deviation value is close to the mean, and a high standard deviation value indicates the data are spread of large range of values. For example, for the District of Columbia in 2008, for the 732 values of daily fine particulate matter, which ranged from 3.00 - 34.50 (µg/m³), the standard deviation from the average value of 12.40 (µg/m³) was 6.21 (µg/m³).

How?  

    See Location above for instructions.
    See also Group Results By in Step 1. 

Notes:  

    The states and the District of Columbia are identified by both state name and Standard Federal Information Processing (FIPS) codes in data extracts. See About FIPS Codes below. 

County
County-level data are available for the United States and the District of Columbia. For county level data, you can select any combination of individual counties, or group by County. Leave the Location Finder selection at the default (all locations or the 48 United States and the District of Columbia).
How?  

    See Location above for instructions.
    See also Group Results By in Step 1. 

Notes:  

    The county coded represents the spatial average of data observations from 1 kilometer square spatial resolution grids. Grids are coded to the county that includes the grid centroid.
    The counties and the District of Columbia are identified by both county name and Standard Federal Information Processing (FIPS) codes in data extracts. The county locations are from the 1999-2000 Federal Information Processing (FIPS) code set.
    About FIPS Codes:   The FIPS State and county codes were established by the National Bureau of Standards, U.S. Department of Commerce in 1968. This standard set of codes provides names and codes for counties and county equivalents of the 50 States of the United States and the District of Columbia. Counties are considered to be the "first order subdivisions" of each State, regardless of their local designation (county, parish, borough, census area). Washington, D.C.; the consolidated government of Columbus City, Georgia; the independent cities of the States of Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia; and the census areas and boroughs of Alaska are identified as county equivalents. The system is standard throughout the Federal Government. The State codes are ascending, two-digit numbers; the county codes are ascending three-digit numbers. For both the State and county codes, space has been left for new States or counties. Some changes in the FIPS codes and county boundaries have occurred since 1968. See Location Updates for information on how these changes affect the data.
    About County Changes:   Comparable measures may be misleading for counties with changing boundaries. See Location Updates for information on how these changes affect the data. Due to boundary changes, data are available for some counties for a limited period of time. The following county-level constraints apply to the data:
        Alaska: data for Alaska are not included in this NLDAS average daily air temperature collection.
        Colorado:
            Broomfield county, Colorado (FIPS code 08014) - data are not available for this entity. 
        Florida:
            Dade county, Florida (FIPS code 12025) - data are shown for the Dade county code value 12025, also the location of Miami, Florida. 
        Hawaii: data for Hawaii are not included in this NLDAS average daily air temperature collection. 


Step 3. Select year, month and day:
Select the time period for the query. Any number of dates can be specified here. Choose between these three controls:

    The Date Range control is selected at first by default, with the full time period of available data shown in the range controls. Use this control to select a continuous span of time, such as May 25, 2010 - September 25, 2010.
    Individual date fields allow you to separately limit or filter data for Year (2003-2011), Month (January - December), and Day of Month (1-31) or Day of Year (1-366). Use this control to select a specific point in time, such as the average measure for the months of June, July and August.

    Click a round button to indicate Day of Month Fields.
    Click your left Mouse button on any desired single option in the list box.
    Press the Ctrl key while clicking your left Mouse button to make multiple selections.
    Press the Shift key while clicking your left Mouse button and dragging the selection for a range of values. 

Notes:  
Data are reported as "Missing" when the selections in the Individual Date Fields are not found in the data. For example, if data are limited to Day of Month values (29, 30, 31) for All Years in the month of February, then data are only reported for February 29 in year 2004 and year 2008. If the query also shows the data grouped by "Day of Month" and shows zero-value rows, then you see "Missing" in the cells for days 30 and 31.

Step 4. Select values:
Limit your data to the selected average daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5) values (µg/m³). PM2.5 particles are air pollutants with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. The average daily values in the 2003-2011 data set range from 0 to >=65 (µg/m³).

Fine Particulate Matter (µg/m³)

Limit your data to the selected fine particulate matter values. Select All Values or any combination of the individual values in the list box.
How?  

    Click a round button to switch between Ranges or Lists, in Section 4.
    Hints for the fine particulate matter Range fields:
        Leave the box blank to use the default value for the threshold, which is displayed below each box inside parenthesis.
        Type in your desired range of sunlight values, use whole numbers. For example, to limit data to all values above 60 (µg/m³), you would type 60 in the lower range box and leave the upper range box blank.
        Click the blue counter-clockwise swoop image to the right of the date range fields to reset the entries to the default values (all). 
    Hints for the List:
        Click your left Mouse button on any desired single option in the list box.
        To select more than one value in the list, press down the Ctrl key on your keyboard while you click your left Mouse button. You can select specific, distinct values that are not contiguous in the list.
        To select a range of contiguous values, press down the Shift key on your keyboard while you click and drag your left Mouse button. 

Notes:  

    Note that the values in the list box are the range of average daily values available in the data.
    Values are a spatial average of the daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5) values recorded for each 10 kilometer square spatial resolution grid, aggregated at the county level.
    PM2.5 particles are air pollutants with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. The average daily values in the 2003-2011 data set range from 0 to >=65 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³).
    About the upper threshold:
    A threshold of 65 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³) was included as part of the Bspline model parameters. A threshold is needed since the Bspline is a fitting technique and not an interpolating technique. When fitting a sparse dataset, the fitted values can reach very high levels near the geographic boundaries. In this data set, values above a threshold of 65 (µg/m³) are truncated, or set to a maximum value of 65, because this value was the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for PM2.5 (98th percentile, averaged over 3 years) at the time this algorithm was developed.

Data Source Information
Data Sources: 	   	

In a study funded by the NASA Applied Sciences Program / Public Health Program (fully cited below), scientists at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center / Universities Space Research Association modified the regional surfacing algorithm of Al-Hamdan et al. (2009) and used it to generate continuous spatial surfaces (grids) of daily PM2.5 for the whole conterminous U.S. for 2003-2011. Two sources of environmental data were used as input to the surfacing algorithm, US EPA AQS PM2.5 in-situ data and NASA MODIS aerosol optical depth remotely sensed data. They also identified in a Geographic Information System (GIS) the associated geographic locations of the centroids of the gridded PM2.5 dataset in terms of the counties and states they fall into to enable aggregation to different geographic levels in CDC WONDER

Cautions and Limitations

    Users are cautioned from averaging daily PM2.5 data over long time periods (annual and longer) and presenting such means alone as that may convey an incomplete and sometimes misleading picture by ignoring variability on daily and seasonal time scales.
    "Because the MODIS aerosol retrieval algorithm is based on dark surface pixels in the near-infrared at 2.1 µm, the difference in the surface reflectance in different regions and seasons can cause the difference in the accuracy of aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals. Over a high-reflectance surface, the retrieved AODs are less accurate. The eastern United States, which is covered with green vegetation, has low reflectance during the warm seasons, whereas the western United States is mostly rocky and desert, which has high reflectance. During the winter, early spring, and late fall, the vegetation in the east turns reddish and the surface reflectance increases. This is one reason that the western United States has lower correlation between AOD and PM2.5 than the eastern United States and that the high correlations are usually observed in summer and fall. It also has been noted in previous papers (Engel-Cox et al., 2004, Engel-Cox et al., 2006, Hutchison et al., 2008) that AOD in the west arises more from smoke events, which may be transported more aloft than the high-AOD pollution events in the east. High AOD-PM2.5 correlations are usually found in areas with high variations of particulate matter. Because the intercepts in the regression relation are not zero, the PM2.5 with low values cannot be detected by AOD and small variations in PM2.5 should not introduce corresponding AOD variations. Pollution events are mostly found over the eastern United States and cover a large area during warm seasons caused by smoke or anthropogenic air pollution. It can be seen that the average PM2.5 has a maximum value over regions 1-7 during summer and a minimum value during winter. This may be another reason to explain the observed seasonal pattern over the east." (Zhang et al., 2009; pages 1360-1361).
    "One of the limitations of the PM2.5 surface-fitting model is the difficulty of incorporating meteorological factors such as wind velocity, which affects the advection of particulates from point sources within the region; the mixing height of the atmosphere, which significantly affects the environmental hazard distribution (Joffre et al. 2001, Gupta et al. 2006, Paciorek et al. 2008, Al-Hamdan, et al., 2009); and relative humidity (RH), which significantly affects the size of the hygroscopic particles and the light extinction efficiency. The MODIS column measurements used in this study could be combined in future work with profile information provided by satellites like the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) to provide a more robust remotely-sensed dataset. Also, new algorithms designed to provide better AOD retrievals in regions of sparse vegetation such as (Hsu et al. 2004) could be applied to improve PM2.5 estimates in the western United States." (Al-Hamdan et al., 2014; page 96).

Location Updates: notes about specific county-level changes in boundaries and codes

Comparable measures may be misleading for counties with changing boundaries. The data collection may lag behind some Federal Information Processing (FIPS) location code changes. Some places, such as independent cities and New York City boroughs are included as unique locations in the data. Some county and census tract area (CA) locations are not included, instead the data are associated with a neighboring county or the previous location name and FIPS code. The list below of county-level changes is organized alphabetically by state name and then county name.

    Alaska boroughs and census areas:
    Data are not available for the state of Alaska, nor Alaskan boroughs and census areas.
    Colorado: Broomfield county
    Broomfield county, Colorado (FIPS code 08014) was created effective November 15, 2001 from parts of four counties: Adams, Boulder, Jefferson, and Weld. Data are not available for Broomfield county. Data are aggregated within the previous boundaries of adjacent Adams, Boulder, Jefferson, and Weld counties.
    Florida: Dade county and Miami city
    Dade county, Florida (FIPS code 12025) was renamed Miami-Dade County and its FIPS code changed to 12086, effective November 13, 1997. The previous label and code, Dade county (FIPS code 12025), are used here.
    Maryland: Baltimore city and Baltimore county
    The independent city of Baltimore, Maryland has been treated as a county. Data are reported separately for Baltimore city (FIPS code 24510) and Baltimore county (FIPS code 24005).
    Missouri:
        St. Genevieve county, Missouri
        In order to achieve alphabetical consistency, the FIPS code for St. Genevieve, Missouri was changed in 1979 from 29193 to 29186. The new code (29186) is used here.
        St. Louis city and St. Louis county, Missouri
        The independent city of St. Louis, Missouri has been treated as a county. Data are reported separately for St. Louis city (FIPS code 29510) and St. Louis county (FIPS code 29189). 
    Nevada: Carson City
    The independent city of Carson City, Nevada (FIPS code 32510) has been treated as a county. Data are shown separately from the adjacent counties for Carson City, Nevada.
    New York: New York City boroughs
    The five boroughs of New York City have been treated as counties and maintained as separate entities.
    Borough 	County 	FIPS Code
    Bronx 	Bronx 	36005
    Brooklyn 	Kings 	36047
    Manhattan 	New York 	36061

        Clifton Forge city, Virginia
        On July 1, 2001, Clifton Forge city, Virginia (FIPS code 51560), formerly an independent city, merged with Alleghany county (FIPS code 51005). However, data for Clifton Forge city are reported separately from Alleghany county, Virginia (FIPS code 51005) for all years.
        Nansemond city, Virginia
        Nansemond city, Virginia (FIPS code 51123) has been part of the independent city of Suffolk, VA (FIPS code 51800) since 1979. For all years, data for Nansemond are aggregated and reported with those for Suffolk city.
        Table of Virginia independent cities and counties
        The Virginia independent cities are treated as counties and appear on the data with the following FIPS codes:
