Data are from the reports:

    Low-Income and Low-Supermarket-Access Census Tracts, 2010-2015
    Access to Affordable and Nutritious Food: Updated Estimates of Distance to Supermarkets Using 2010 Data

Indicator: Population, low access to store

Geographic level: County

Definition: Number of people in a county living more than 1 mile from a supermarket or large grocery store if in an urban area, or more than 10 miles from a supermarket or large grocery store if in a rural area.

Data sources: In each of the referenced reports, a directory of supermarkets and large grocery stores authorized to accept SNAP benefits was merged with Trade Dimensions' TDLinx directory of stores within the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii, for the years 2010 and 2015. Stores met the definition of a supermarket or large grocery store if they reported at least $2 million in annual sales and contained all the major food departments found in a traditional supermarket, including fresh meat and poultry, dairy, dry and packaged foods, and frozen foods. The combined list of supermarkets and large grocery stores was converted into a GIS-usable format by geocoding the street address into store-point locations. Population data are reported at the block level from the 2010 Census of Population and Housing. These population data were aerially allocated down to ½-kilometer-square grids across the United States. For each ½-kilometer-square grid cell, the distance was calculated from its geographic center to the center of the grid cell with the nearest supermarket. Rural or urban status is designated by the Census Bureau’s Urban Area definition.

Available years: 2010 and 2015
Indicator: Population, low access to store (percent change)

Geographic level: County

Definition: The percent change in the number of people in a county living more than 1 mile from a supermarket or large grocery store if in an urban area, or more than 10 miles from a supermarket or large grocery store if in a rural area. Percent change indicators are calculated as: [((Year 2 - Year 1) / Year 1) x 100].

Data sources: In each of the referenced reports, a directory of supermarkets and large grocery stores authorized to accept SNAP benefits was merged with Trade Dimensions' TDLinx directory of stores within the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii, for the years 2010 and 2015. Stores met the definition of a supermarket or large grocery store if they reported at least $2 million in annual sales and contained all the major food departments found in a traditional supermarket, including fresh meat and poultry, dairy, dry and packaged foods, and frozen foods.

Rural or urban status is designated by the Census Bureau’s Urban Area definition. Once distance to the nearest supermarket or large grocery store was calculated for each grid cell, the number of individuals living more than 1 mile from a supermarket or large grocery store in urban areas and more than 10 miles from a supermarket or large grocery store in rural areas was aggregated to the county level and divided by the total number of individuals in the county to obtain the percentage of total population in the county that resided more than 1 or 10 miles from a supermarket.

Geographic level: County

Definition: Percentage of people in a county who are Black living more than 1 mile from a supermarket or large grocery store if in an urban area, or more than 10 miles from a supermarket or large grocery store if in a rural area.

Data sources: In each of the referenced reports, a directory of supermarkets and large grocery stores authorized to accept SNAP benefits was merged with Trade Dimensions' TDLinx directory of stores within the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii, for the years 2010 and 2015. Stores met the definition of a supermarket or large grocery store if they reported at least $2 million in annual sales and contained all the major food departments found in a traditional supermarket, including fresh meat and poultry, dairy, dry and packaged foods, and frozen foods. The combined list of supermarkets and large grocery stores was converted into a GIS-usable format by geocoding the street address into store-point locations. Population data are reported at the block level from the 2010 Census of Population and Housing.

For each ½-kilometer-square grid cell, the distance was calculated from its geographic center to the center of the grid cell with the nearest supermarket. Rural or urban status is designated by the Census Bureau’s Urban Area definition. Once distance to the nearest supermarket or large grocery store was calculated for each grid cell, the number of Black individuals living more than 1 mile from the nearest supermarket or large grocery store in urban areas and more than 10 miles from a supermarket or large grocery store in rural areas was aggregated to the county level and divided by the total number of Black individuals in the county to obtain the percentage of Black individuals in the county that resided more than 1 or 10 miles from a supermarket.

Geographic level: State

Definition: Prevalence of household-level food insecurity by State. Food-insecure households were unable, at times during the year, to provide adequate food for one or more household members because the household lacked money and other resources for food.

Data sources: ERS estimates using 3 years of data from the Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement, as reported in Table 5 in the referenced report, Household Food Security in the United States in 2015 (September 2016). The food security survey asks one adult respondent in each household a series of questions about experiences and behaviors that indicate food insecurity. The food security status of the household was assessed based on the number of food-insecure conditions reported (such as being unable to afford balanced meals, cutting the size of meals because of too little money for food, or being hungry because of too little money for food). Note: margins of error are substantial for some States; comparisons between States should take into consideration margins of error published in the source report.

Food Insecurity in Households With Children: Prevalence, Severity, and Household Characteristics, 2010-11

Geographic level: State

Definition: Percentage of households with children in which children were food insecure, by State. Households with food-insecure children were unable, at times during the year, to provide adequate food for one or more child because the household lacked money and other resources for food. For most of these households, inadequacy was in quality and variety of foods; for about one in ten, amounts of food provided were also inadequate.

Data sources: Data are from an annual survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau as a supplement to the monthly Current Population Survey. USDA sponsors the annual survey, and USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) compiles and analyzes the responses. The surveys were of representative samples of the U.S. civilian population and included between 15,000 and 18,000 households with children each year. (However, about a fourth of the sample in the 2007 survey was not used for food security estimates because a proposed wording change tested in those households did not perform adequately.) The survey is conducted both by telephone and in person so that households with no telephone are not underrepresented. The food security survey asked one adult respondent in each household a series of questions about experiences and behaviors that indicate food insecurity. The food security status of children in the household was assessed by responses to a subset of questions about the conditions and experiences of children. For more information on the methodology, see the referenced report, Food Insecurity in Households With Children: Prevalence, Severity, and Household Characteristics, 2010-11 (EIB 113, table 3, May 2013).

Data sources: The National Farm to School Network conducted surveys on whether school districts conducted farm-to-school activities in school year 2011-12 or school year 2012-13, and compiled the data from these surveys as well as a self-reporting registry maintained by the Network since 2007, supplemented by the Network’s periodic updating efforts. To map farm-to-school programs by county, the list of programs was linked to Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) county codes if the program covered the whole county, National Center of Education Statistics Common Core of Data (CCD) school district codes if the program covered the school district, and CCD school codes if the program was limited to an individual school. A county is counted as having a farm-to-school program whether the program covers the whole county or whether the program operates only in a school or school district within the county.
